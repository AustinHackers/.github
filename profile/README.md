# Austin Hackers Anonymous

## Who we are
The Austin Hackers Association is a loose group of hackers and security professionals in the Austin, Texas area. We have monthly meetings that do have rules. We also occasionally eat sushi, BBQ, and drink beer together.

## Our Meetings
The meetings consist of short “turbo-talks” from anyone that would like to speak on a topic for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. There is a projector and screen (HDMI only) if you wish to use a slide deck or perform demos.

## Participation
Participation is mandatory for continued membership in the group. What this means is that to retain a subscription to the mailing list and to be allowed entrance to the meetings, you must contribute to the group in some form. The best way to do this is to attend the meetings and speak about what you’re working on, what you’re up to, etc.
